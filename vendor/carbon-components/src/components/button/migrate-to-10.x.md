### HTML

Icon from [`carbon-elements`](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements) package is now used. Vanilla markup should be migrated to one shown in [carbondesignsystem.com](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code) site. React and other framework variants should reflect the change automatically.
