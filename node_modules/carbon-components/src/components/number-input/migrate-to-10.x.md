### HTML

Icon from [`carbon-elements`](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements) package is now used. Also some internal changes involves changing the markup structure a bit. Vanilla markup should be migrated to one shown in [carbondesignsystem.com](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/components/number-input/code) site. React and other framework variants should reflect the change automatically.
